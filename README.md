NEW -> See the WPILIB Vision Examples folder for the PC DLL that enables OpenCV: opencv_java344.dll
You must download this file and place it somewhere in your windows path.
It was recommended to put it in the Java bin directory but that is a bad idea.
You might upgrade Java and then not know why the OpenCV Library broke.
Also, Java bin might not actually be in your path.

If wouldn't be terrible to put it here:
C:\Users\Public\frc2019\frccode

Make sure this is in your path.  (type PATH from the command line)

EVERY FILE NEEDED FOR CODE, WILL ADD AS WE GO INTO VISION, ETC.
